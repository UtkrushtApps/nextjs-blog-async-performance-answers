# Solution Steps

1. Bootstrap a Next.js + TypeScript app and install styled-components and SWR.

2. In 'types/blog.ts', define interfaces for BlogPostMeta, BlogPost, and EngagementSSR.

3. In 'utils/posts.ts', implement static demo post data and export async functions 'getAllPostsMeta' and 'getPostBySlug' that support multiple languages.

4. In 'utils/engagement.ts', implement 'fetchEngagement' to provide real-time SSR counts for comments/likes.

5. In 'utils/analytics.ts', implement 'postAnalytics' for non-blocking (background) analytics submission on page loads.

6. In 'utils/fetcher.ts', implement a generic fetch helper for client-side data fetching.

7. In 'utils/i18n.ts', define a minimal i18n system with messages, language detection, the 'languages' array, and a typed translation helper 't'.

8. Implement the main blog list at 'pages/index.tsx', statically fetching all post metadata for each language and linking to localized post pages.

9. Implement '[lang]/posts/[slug].tsx' to statically generate each post (for each language), server-rendering engagement data (using SSR), and trigger background analytics on mount. Display loader for fallback and error states.

10. Create a custom typed hook 'useBlogPost' in 'hooks/useBlogPost.ts' that fetches blog post data client-side, transforming types using mapped/utility/conditional types, with loading/error state.

11. Develop 'components/BlogEditor.tsx' as a React component for creating/editing posts, providing loading/error/success UI. Use styled-components for theming.

12. In 'pages/editor.tsx', dynamically import the blog editor component (lazy load), wrapping it in a styled container.

13. Implement the analytics API endpoint in 'pages/api/analytics.ts' and the post API endpoint in 'pages/api/posts/[lang]/[slug].ts'.

14. Set up 'pages/_app.tsx' to wrap the app with ThemeProvider from styled-components and inject global styles.

15. Create 'styles/GlobalStyle.ts' and 'styles/globals.css' for overall theme and typography.

16. Test: Confirm posts are statically generated in all languages, dynamic engagement is SSR, analytics is sent in background, and the editor supports dynamic import, error, and loading states.
